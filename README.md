# Activity Recognition for Glass
This application is very similar to https://github.com/7yl4r/AvatarWallpaper, which was
created by one of my former labmates, Tylar Murray. This application determines how 
physically active the user is and provides positive feedback in order to convince the
user to be physically active. It is based on the proteus effect
(See https://vhil.stanford.edu/pubs/2007/yee-proteus-effect.pdf).

This application was developed during Spring 2014.
